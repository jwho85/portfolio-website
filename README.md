# Portfolio Website

The objective of this project was to build a responsive website using HTML and CSS that will showcase my professional portfolio, which will include the projects I’ll build throughout my Full-Stack Web Development Program.

## The 5 Ws

1. Who—Your professional network, as well as potential employers. The website will be for anyone interested in your professional work and who might want to contact you about it. 
2. What—A responsive portfolio website built with HTML and CSS. 
3. When—The website might be visited when a potential employer is checking out your previous experience; or, after you’ve met a professional contact and they want to see what you’re up to. 
4. Where—Potential employers might look at the website from their offices, while networking contacts might access it from their mobile phones (e.g., after meeting you). 
5. Why—For your potential employers, clients, or collaborators to learn more about your professional experience and relevant skills, as well as how to reach you. The site will also demonstrate your frontend development skills to employers.
